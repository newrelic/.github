      New Relic requires that all open source projects have an associated
      license contained within the project. This license must be permissive (e.g.
      non-viral or copyleft), and we recommend Apache 2.0 for most use cases

      New Relic requires a README file in all projects. This README should
      give a general overview of the project, and should point to additional resources
      (security, contributing, etc.) where developers and users can learn further

      The README of a community plus project should have a community plus
      header at the start of the README. If you already have a community plus header
      and this rule is failing, your header may be out of date, and you should
      update your header with the suggested one below

      (`https://github.com/newrelic/<repo-name>/security/policy` or `../../security/policy`)
      in the README. For an example of this, please see the "a note about vulnerabilities"
      section of the [Open By Default repository](https://github.com/newrelic/open-by-default#contribute)

      New Relic has moved the `CODE_OF_CONDUCT` file to a [centralized location](https://github.com/newrelic/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
      where it is referenced automatically by every repository in the New Relic organization. Because of this change, any other `CODE_OF_CONDUCT` file
      in a repository is now redundant and should be removed. Note that you will need to adjust any links to the local `CODE_OF_CONDUCT` file in your
      documentation to point to the central file (`README` and `CONTRIBUTING` will probably have links that need updating)

      A [`THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`](https://github.com/newrelic/opensource-website/blob/develop/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md)
      file can be present in your repository to grant attribution to all dependencies
      being used by this project. This document is necessary if you are using
      third-party source code in your project, with the exception of code referenced outside
      the project's compiled/bundled binary (ex. some Java projects require modules to
      be pre-installed in the classpath, outside the project binary and therefore
      outside the scope of the `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES`). Please
      review your project's dependencies and create a THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md file if
      necessary. For JavaScript projects, you can generate this file using the
      [oss-cli](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-oss-cli)
